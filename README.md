## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Two images have a small purple circle around them. I used outline instead of border because the images total width and height wouldn't be affected by the outline. If I had used border I would have had to resize the two images and also apply negative margin to them.
- I was running into an issue where 'inline-block' was causing extra space around text and my elements weren't lining up correctly. Instead I wrapped the content in a container and applied display flex on the container to solve this.
